# okf verify

Appends a valid document-level `{by, at}` verification event after content has been checked against its sources or resource. This is distinct from per-run computation attestation.

## Arguments

| Argument | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `<concept>` | positional | yes | Concept id to verify |
| `<bundle>` | positional | no | Bundle directory (explicit, then $OKF_BUNDLE, nearest okf.toml, or current directory) |
| `--by <value>` | string | yes | The reviewing actor (e.g. `human:andrey` or `process:ci`) |
| `--require-ontology-gate` | bool | no | Require the ontology write gate even when bundle policy leaves it disabled (default: `false`) |

Global `--json` requests NDJSON. The optional trailing `bundle` positional is a path; `--bundle-id` selects a catalog identity. Selection uses explicit path or ID, `$OKF_BUNDLE` (path), registered containing bundle, configured default, sole catalog entry, then uncataloged cwd. Selection and examination scope are separate.

Output stream: `change`.

Supported global options: `--bundle-id`, `--json`.
